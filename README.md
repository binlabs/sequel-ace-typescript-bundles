# Sequel Ace Typescript Bundles

A collection of bundles for Sequel Ace meant to aide in development of Typescript projects.

## Bundles

There are currently two Typescript-related bundles whose descriptions you can see below.

### Typescript Interface

This bundle allows you to generate a Typescript interface from the table(s) that you have selected.

### Typescript Sequelize Model with Interface

From the table(s) that you have selected, this bundle allows you to generate a [Sequelize](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize) model and an accompanying interface, which will be used to instantiate a class for the model.

## Installation and Usage

2. Double-click on the bundle package to install it.
3. Launch Sequel Ace and connect to a database. Select one or more tables, then choose a command from the **Bundles** > **Generate** menu.
